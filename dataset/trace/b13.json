I mounted mine in a home brew table and used a router lift. The smooth operation variable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results. Its well made and user friendly. You'll love it!",

      "question": " This router is 1 of 4 in my shop. It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot. I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup! This router has soft start and runs smooth and true. I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems. It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish. For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup. You just can't go wrong with this one! Enjoy.",

      "question": " At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V. I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP. I bought it! I have 5 routers, I use them all! I make furniture and cabinetry. I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable. Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering. The M12V has been great. The height adjustment works well- not perfect. The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog. The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail. What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking. Good luck and cut wood!!!!",
