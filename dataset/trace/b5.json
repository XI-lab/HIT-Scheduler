      "question": " I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed. Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up. The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob. I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference. The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out. Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely. I never could get the panel bit to fit right.",

I have a mid-size plunge router already, (the DeWalt 621-a fantastic router, read the MANY reviews) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table.",

      "question": " I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand. But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits. At first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise. The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!) However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table). Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it. The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table. Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.",

      "question": " It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty. But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record. I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits. Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit. Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway. So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that. Happy woodworking!!",

      "question": " Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router. It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation. Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into. Hitachi includes a 1/2\" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table. I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for. And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench, one hand on the spindle lock, and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table. In my table the M12V has been a real champ. I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees. The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it. With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls). Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2\" shank, 1/2\" diameter, 1\" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4\" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a \"13 mm\" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too) Not included are: - 3/8\" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering The M12V is really set up for right hand operation. Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening. This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate. Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4\" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.",

      "question": " This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses. Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig. The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation. It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired. The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate. I used this router to plow out 3\" raised panels in oak without phasing the beast. This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit. The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings. The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy. The only complaint I have is that the 1/4\" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4\" bits. I purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job. The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately. However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it. This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine. Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.",

      "question": " I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time. The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site. I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too. The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly. The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well. The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing. It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use. Those are the good points. There are a few points of contention which I have. The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a \"ball park\" measure. The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so. This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant. The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned. Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance. I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use. Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.",

      "question": " This is an excellent router for the money. I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim. The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust. I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much. Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.",

Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any. I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud. I have many others in the past. I would put the Hitachi up with the best! No vibration! Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant. It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely. Why do people spend all that money on accessories to \"raise and lower \" the router in a table??? A waste of money. It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great. Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models. The soft start is nice. The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you) The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 ! Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer. I can't complain and Amazons' service was perfect! I think I'll go rout something...",

      "question": " Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it. I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper. Gave the Dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop. Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out. UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table. Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand. It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried. I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy). Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws). LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following: 1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism. Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars). I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention. Not a killer problem, but not well done, either. 2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts. Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference. I do woodworking as a serious hobby. For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result. Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.",

      "question": " My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop. The owner had three routers - all M12's. This was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router. In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines. After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking. On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well. I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances. The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged. Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice. If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..",
